## What is it about?
In this game it is your job to clear a parking lot of as much snow as fast as possible. Both speed and cleanliness are important for getting a good score. So get to work!

## Important
Since we did not have access to VR-hardware (HMD and hand trackers), we had to try and EMULATE the VR experience. 
So although this project was build for for VR systems, you can't actually play it using a VR headset, but use Mouse and Keyboard instead.

## Downloading and starting the game
In this repo you will find the project files as well as a built version of the project
The build Windows version can be found [HERE](https://github.com/PapediPoo/Snowplow/tree/master/Build)

## How to play
Note that in the settings you can change between VR-mode and normal mode. This also changes the control scheme of the game. Simply toggle the setting in the options menu to switch between modes

* **A/D**: Turn snowblower left/right
* **Q**: Toggle drive clutch
* **E**: Toggle auger clutch
* **Esc**: Back to menu

### VR-mode controls
We use the standard control scheme for Unity's XR Device Simulator
* **Left mouse button**:  Interact
* **Right mouse button**: Move camera
* **G**: Grip
* **Left shift**: Move left hand
* **Spacebar**: Move right hand
* **Left ctrl**: Rotate
* **Move mouse**: move current selection up/down/left/right
* **Scroll mouse wheel**: Move current selection inwards outwards

If you are in VR-mode, you can interact with the dashboard of the snowblower. This is also how you can control the machine. There are a total of **6 buttons** that you can interact with.

The speed up/speed down buttons allow you to change the driving speed of the snowblower.
